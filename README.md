## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to utilize my skills of Flexbox to some extant.
Ofc these challenges are not tough, therefore I am not really learning something new. But, at least I am able to know that I can make these pages.

### Continued development

I will start learning JavaScript and will soon try some more complicated challenges which can help me upgrade my skills.
